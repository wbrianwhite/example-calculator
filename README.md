# Fraction Calculator
--------------------

The app uses the [Fractions package](https://github.com/danm-de/Fractions/blob/master/license.txt) to handle fractions.

The app loops over the args[] array twice, first completing any multiplication/division operations, next completing any addition/subtraction operations.
